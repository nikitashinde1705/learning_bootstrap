                    <h1>Kedarnath</h1>
                    <p>Kedarnath is a pilgrimage site or tirtha dedicated to the Hindu deity
                         Shiva. It is one of the four pilgrimage spots that form a part of the
                          Uttarkhand Char Dham yatra or Chota Char Dham yatra.[6] The temple's 
                          construction is credited to the Pandava brothers mentioned in the Mahabharata.
                          However, the Mahabharata does not mention any place called Kedarnath. One of the 
                          earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the Skanda Purana (c. 7th-8th century),
                           which names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where Shiva released the holy waters of 
                           Ganga from his matted hair, resulting in the formation of the Ganges River.
                        The Acharyas rebuilt the Kedarnath temple in Uttarakhand under the guidance of Adi Shankaracharya. 
                        According to the hagiographies based on Madhava's Sankshepa-Shankara-Vijaya, the 8th-century philosopher
                         Adi Shankaracharya died near the Kedarnath mountains; although other hagiographies, based on Anandagiri's
                          Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya, state that he died at Kanchipuram. The ruins of a monument marking the purported
                           resting place of Adi Shankaracharya are located at Kedarnath.</p>

                    <p>In earlier days, pilgrims used to walk hundreds of miles to visit the Badrinath temple.[7] The temple has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and avalanches. As late as the First World War, the town consisted only of the 20-odd huts used by the temple's staff, but the site drew thousands each year and up to 50,000 on its duodecennial festivals (every twelve years).[8] In recent years its popularity has increased still more, with an estimated 600,000 pilgrims visiting during the 2006 season,[9] compared to 90,676 in 1961.[10] The temple in Badrinath is also a sacred pilgrimage site for Vaishnavites. Badrinath is also gateway to several mountaineering expeditions headed to mountains like Nilkantha.</p>

                    Gangotri is one of the four sites in the Chota Char Dham pilgrimage circuit. It is also the origin of the Ganges river and, per Hinduism, the seat of the goddess Ganga. The source of the Ganges river is the Bhagirathi River, originating from the Gangotri Glacier.[1] Once the river confluences with the Alakananda River at a town called Devprayag it finally acquires the name Ganga.[2]
                    Near the river is a stone where King Bhagiratha performed penance to Shiva in order to bring the Ganga down to earth and absolve the sins of his ancestors.[3] According to another legend, Pandavas performed the great 'Deva Yajna' here to atone the deaths of their kinsmen in the epic battle of the Mahabharata. Hindus believe that performing the ancestral rites on the banks of Bhagirathi frees the spirit of the ancestor from the cycle of rebirth and a holy dip in its waters cleanses sins committed in the present also past births
